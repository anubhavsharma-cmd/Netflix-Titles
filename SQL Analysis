-- STEP 1: TABLE CREATION
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix_titles;
CREATE TABLE netflix_titles (
    show_id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(20),
    title VARCHAR(255),
    director VARCHAR(255),
    cast TEXT,
    country VARCHAR(100),
    date_added VARCHAR(50),
    release_year INT,
    rating VARCHAR(50),
    duration VARCHAR(50),
    listed_in TEXT,
    description TEXT
);

-- STEP 2: DATA IMPORT
-- Use MySQL Workbench > Table Data Import Wizard or LOAD DATA INFILE

-- STEP 3: INITIAL EXPLORATION

-- 3.1: Structure of the table
DESCRIBE netflix_titles;

-- 3.2: Sample records
SELECT * FROM netflix_titles LIMIT 10;

-- 3.3: Total number of records
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM netflix_titles;
-- Insight: Shows total number of titles in the dataset.

-- 3.4: Count NULL or empty values in important columns
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN director IS NULL OR director = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_director,
  SUM(CASE WHEN cast IS NULL OR cast = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_cast,
  SUM(CASE WHEN country IS NULL OR country = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_country,
  SUM(CASE WHEN date_added IS NULL OR date_added = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_date_added,
  SUM(CASE WHEN rating IS NULL OR rating = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_rating,
  SUM(CASE WHEN duration IS NULL OR duration = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_duration
FROM netflix_titles;
-- Insight: Helps determine where to clean missing values.

-- STEP 4: DATA CLEANING

-- 4.1: Remove duplicates (based on title, type, release year)
DELETE FROM netflix_titles
WHERE show_id NOT IN (
    SELECT * FROM (
        SELECT MIN(show_id)
        FROM netflix_titles
        GROUP BY title, type, release_year
    ) AS temp
);
-- Insight: Ensures uniqueness of records.

-- 4.2: Fill NULLs and empty values with 'Unknown'
UPDATE netflix_titles SET director = 'Unknown' WHERE director IS NULL OR director = '';
UPDATE netflix_titles SET cast = 'Unknown' WHERE cast IS NULL OR cast = '';
UPDATE netflix_titles SET country = 'Unknown' WHERE country IS NULL OR country = '';
UPDATE netflix_titles SET date_added = 'Unknown' WHERE date_added IS NULL OR date_added = '';
UPDATE netflix_titles SET rating = 'Unknown' WHERE rating IS NULL OR rating = '';
UPDATE netflix_titles SET duration = 'Unknown' WHERE duration IS NULL OR duration = '';
-- Insight: Replaces blank fields for consistent analysis.

-- STEP 5: FEATURE ENGINEERING

-- 5.1: Extract year from date_added into a new column
ALTER TABLE netflix_titles ADD COLUMN year_added INT;

UPDATE netflix_titles
SET year_added = CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(date_added, '-', 1) AS UNSIGNED)
WHERE date_added != 'Unknown';
-- Insight: Enables trend analysis over time.

-- STEP 6: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

-- 6.1: Number of Movies vs TV Shows
SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS total_titles
FROM netflix_titles
GROUP BY type;
-- Insight: Netflix has more Movies than TV Shows.

-- 6.2: Number of titles added per year

FROM netflix_titles
WHERE year_added IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY year_added
ORDER BY year_added;
-- Insight: Content additions increased significantly post-2016.

-- 6.3: Top 10 countries producing content
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM netflix_titles
WHERE country != 'Unknown'
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 6.4: Most frequent ratings
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM netflix_titles
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY total DESC;
-- Insight: TV-MA, TV-14, and R are the most common ratings.

-- 6.5: Top 10 most popular genres
SELECT listed_in, COUNT(*) AS genre_count
FROM netflix_titles
GROUP BY listed_in
ORDER BY genre_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
-- Insight: Dramas, Comedies, and Documentaries are dominant genres.

-- 6.6: Average duration of movies
SELECT 
    AVG(CAST(REPLACE(duration, ' min', '') AS UNSIGNED)) AS avg_movie_duration
FROM netflix_titles
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND duration LIKE '%min%';
-- Insight: The average Netflix movie duration is about 95 minutes.

-- 6.7: Number of TV Shows by season count
SELECT 
    duration AS seasons,
    COUNT(*) AS show_count
